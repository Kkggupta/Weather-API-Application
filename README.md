# Weather-API-Application

Introduction:
The Weather API App is a simple yet powerful application designed to provide users with real-time weather information for any location. By leveraging external weather APIs, the app fetches data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. This project serves as an educational exercise in working with APIs, data parsing, and presenting information in a user-friendly interface.
